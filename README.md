## Hi there 👋

I'm **Aaron**, and I have three core passions:

---

### 🛡️ 1. Security Architect & Vulnerability Researcher

I build world-class security systems at a NASDAQ-listed company — that's my major work.

I love **breaking things**, researching deeply, and fixing vulnerabilities.  
Check out my vulnerability research collection:  
👉 [Common Bugs, Uncommon Exploits](https://github.com/CaledoniaProject/common-bugs-uncommon-exploits)

I'm also an open-source enthusiast, contributing to and testing community projects:  
👉 [Awesome Open Source Security](https://github.com/CaledoniaProject/awesome-opensource-security)

Most notably, I'm the **father of [OpenRASP](http://github.com/baidu/openrasp)** — a powerful Runtime Application Self-Protection system.

### 💻 2. Individual Developer

I build applications as a solo dev — still in the **beta phase**, following the product–market fit cycle and learning from the process.

### 💰 3. Financial Learner & Quant Explorer

I'm a lifelong learner in finance — reading books and writing programs to detect trading signals and navigate the markets.

📡 A site is coming soon. Stay tuned.
